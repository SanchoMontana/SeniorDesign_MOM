This design diagram describes the main methods of attracting
users to continue using our application. We plan to use accountability
among friends as a major push for users to keep up to date with
building their good habits. Along with that, we will implement a pet avatar
that will act as a face for their progress. This should add a game-like
element to completing real-world tasks and building habits.
