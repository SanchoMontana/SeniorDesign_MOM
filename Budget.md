## Budget

As far as software and hardware goes, we have not incurred any additional expense while working on this project. All three developers brought their own computers to
work with, and we have enough phones and computers covering enough operating systems to fully test our app before deploying it. Some costs down the line may
occur due to apple's release policy for iPhone apps (license needed). Cloud storage and processing may also need to be paid for down the line but as of right
now it seems we will be able to do our first release with free cloud resources.

The only other expense we may accrue during development is the contracting of art for the virtual pet feature. Though we have a talented group with a diverse set of
skills, none of us feels confident enough in our artistic ability to use it for a professional app. As such we will need to pay for our visuals, both the actual art
assets for pets and cosmetics and some basic canned animations to make them work. Cost of this will very on who we end up getting to do the art,
our hope is to use someone who is looking to build their portfolio just as we are.
