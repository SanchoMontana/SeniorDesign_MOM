## Co-op Work Experience

augmented reality development, web development, windows application development, and database development. I also learned 
how to research and implement new technologies into existing infrastructures. Additionally I picked up a lot of soft skills,

in working together feel free to reach out to me. I'm an open minded person so if you have an idea you're passionate about
I would love to help make your dream a reality!
