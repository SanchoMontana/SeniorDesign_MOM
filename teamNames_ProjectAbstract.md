## Project Abstract

Our Habit Tracker helps users build and break habits. Users are motivated both by an adorable virtual pet which they earn cosmetic items for based on task completion and by a healthy networking feature which will allow users to encourage their friends and mock their enemies. The app will also feature a fluid user interface, turning the user experience from an adversarial one to amicable one
